Android package for Hatchak layout

I based the android build stuff (IE gratefully ripped off so I didn't have to figure it out) from https://github.com/tialaramex/BritishKeyboard.git
Thanks tialaramex!


Problems:
Android's keyboard input system is far inferior to xkb.  There doesn't seem to be any way to have an altgr or level 3 shift that doesn't also tell an application that the alt key is pressed, so for eg. the terminal, you can either use altgr OR you can set it to send esc when alt is pressed (for, say, emacs-style keybindings).  So your results may be... sub par.

Run `./gradlew build` and an apk will be in app/build/outputs/apk.

I just use the debug apk.

You may have to change the buildToolsVersion in app/build.gradle
