For Hatchak to work reasonably on MacOS, I had to implement both a keyboard layout file (with Ukelele) and some Karabiner configuration.
Also it doesn't support enough modifiers, so I encoded Hyper as a combination of modifiers, which I believe was Shift + Option.
I'm writing this later, because I configured it all quickly in order to get to work, and I kept the files in my dotfileswgh repo without notes, and now I'm wanting to store the Hatchak-related parts of my configuration in my actual Hatchak repo, but it's now been a while, I haven't had access to a Mac for some time, and I don't remember everything.
Keyboard configurability in MacOS seems better than Windows, but significantly worse than Linux, and maybe even worse than Android.

I guess I'll also include my configuration for iterm in here, because I needed some configuration but I don't remember exactly why, and whether it was related to Hatchak or not.
